# react-nav-drills

I started this project because I was running into a lot of navigation issues at work and needed time to understand it on my own terms before trying to apply the principles to someone else's project.

To run:

- clone this repo
- `yarn install`
- `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
- `yarn run ios`

(Because this is just a scratchpad of an app, I haven't tested it on Android. Sorry to the Android people out there.)
